Task 1:- LANDING PAGE A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, you'll learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements.
